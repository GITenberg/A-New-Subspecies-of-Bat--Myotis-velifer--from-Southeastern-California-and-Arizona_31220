<p>The first specimens of <i>Myotis velifer</i> from California were taken in
1909 by C. L. Camp at Needles, San Bernardino County (Grinnell, Univ.
California Publ. Zool., 12:266, March 20, 1914), and subsequently this
bat was recorded from farther south in the lower Colorado River Valley
at the Riverside Mountains, Riverside County (Stager, Jour. Mamm.,
20:226, May 14, 1939). West of the Rocky Mountains the species is known
to occur also in at least the southern two-thirds of Arizona,
southwestern New Mexico, and is recorded from Thistle Valley, Utah, on
the basis of two young specimens in alcohol (Miller and Allen, Bull. U.
S. Nat. Mus., 144:87, May 25, 1928). Through comparisons made possible
by the acquisition, in the last few years, of mammals from many parts of
Mexico by the Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas, it
became evident that <i>Myotis velifer</i> in California and Arizona was an
heretofore unnamed subspecies. It may be known as</p>

<p><b>Myotis velifer brevis</b> new subspecies</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Miller and Allen (<i>op. cit.</i> :90) considered specimens of
<i>Myotis velifer</i> from Roosevelt, Arizona, to be intergrades between <i>M.
v. velifer</i> and <i>M. v. incautus</i> because the color varied greatly and
certain pale individuals resembled <i>incautus</i>. These workers regarded
specimens from southern Arizona as nearly typical examples of <i>M. v.
velifer</i>. I have examined the specimens from Roosevelt, Arizona, and
many from various localities in the southern part of the state, and was
impressed by the large amount of color varia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>tion. Marked variation in
color at a single locality, however, is known in other bats. Benson
(Jour. Mamm., 30:50, February 14, 1949), for example, found striking
variation in <i>Myotis volans</i> in California. The specimens of <i>Myotis
velifer</i> from Roosevelt, Arizona, referred to <i>M. v. velifer</i> by Miller
and Allen (<i>op. cit.</i> :90), actually average significantly smaller than
specimens of this subspecies from Mexico, and than specimens of the
large subspecies <i>M. v. incautus</i> from the Great Plains, and therefore,
with reference to size, are not intergrades between these subspecies.
All of the Arizonan material is here referred to <i>M. v. brevis</i>.</p>

<p>The "bald spot," that is to say, the sparsely furred area between the
shoulders, which is characteristic of this species, reaches its most
extreme condition in <i>Myotis velifer brevis</i>. In most of thirty-five
specimens taken in mid-June, 1953, in California, the nape of the neck,
the interscapular area, and a connected area extending laterally onto
each shoulder are so lightly furred that the skin shows through
conspicuously. In one male of this series a strip approximately four
millimeters wide extending along the mid-dorsal line from between the
shoulders to the rump is mostly devoid of hair. These sparsely-furred
areas are less evident in live animals than in study skins and specimens
in alcohol, because the back of the head in life lies against the
depression between the shoulders and conceals most of the thinly furred
areas.</p>

<p>The pelage of <i>Myotis velifer brevis</i> is shorter than that of either <i>M.
v. velifer</i> or <i>M. v. incautus</i> and gives the impression of being less
dense. The dorsal hairs average approximately 4.5 millimeters long in
<i>M. v. brevis</i> taken 35 miles north of Blythe, Riverside County,
California, in May, eight millimeters in <i>M. v. velifer</i> collected at
Las Vigas, Veracruz, in January, and six millimeters in <i>M. v. incautus</i>
taken four and one half miles southwest of Sun City, Barber County,
Kansas, in November. More than seasonal differences in length of pelage
is indicated by measurements of additional specimens of each subspecies
taken at different times of the year.</p>

<p>Considering its extensive geographic range and its occurrence in many
contrasting environments, <i>Myotis velifer</i> varies little; and the
variation that does occur is continuous. The change from the large, dark
Mexican subspecies to the small, pale Arizonan subspecies is gradual.
The reason may lie in the ecology of <i>M. velifer</i>. It seems that there
are few barriers separating populations. Waterless areas and regions
lacking suitable roosting places such as fissures in cliffs and outcrops
of rocks, caves and buildings, may exclude the species from certain
areas, but there are few areas of any great size within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span> the range of
the species that lack these features. Also, these bats are strong
fliers; even between fairly distant colonies there may be considerable
gene flow. The geographic variation observed probably is the result of
adaptation, on the part of populations in different parts of the range
of the species, to different environments. The lack of any effective
barriers except possibly distance between populations tends to limit
subspeciation and to cause gradual variation between subspecies. <i>M. v.
peninsularis</i>, the subspecies at the southern tip of Baja California, is
not considered in this discussion. So far as known, however, that
subspecies is completely isolated from the mainland populations of <i>M.
velifer</i>.</p>

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
